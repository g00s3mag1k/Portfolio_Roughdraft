## Description

This Portfolio Website was created from scratch as part of an assignment of a boot camp student. It contains HTML, CSS, and Git structures to simulate an on-the-job experience. Making this website was slighlty more challenging than the other assignments prior to this mini-project. I am excited to learn new techniques as the course progesses.
